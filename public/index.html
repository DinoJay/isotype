          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(picture_language)">Isotype</a>
          visualization. It is not really a consistent translation of the infographic style developed by Otto Neurath, Gerd Arntz and others
          at the 'Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum' in Wien. I just used pictograms
          by <a href="http://www.gerdarntz.org/">Gerd Arntz</a> to polish some standard d3 example.
          Orginally, I intended also to use icons for Income and people, but turned it
          down because I like the visual appeal of circles. In a second iteration
          icons may come. To ackknowledge, this is only an experiment and not real
          piece of information visualization. It does not hold all standards how to
          present data in a meaningful way. The data comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/sipp/">www.census.gov</a>
          and basically shows the distribution of income among graduates in their first jobs (categorized by degrees).
          But for the rest let the data speak!
